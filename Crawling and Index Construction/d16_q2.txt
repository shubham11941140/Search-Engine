Wild animal suffering is the suffering experienced by nonhuman animals living outside of direct human control, due to harms such as disease, injury, parasitism, starvation and malnutrition, dehydration, weather conditions, natural disasters, and killings by other animals,[1][2] as well as psychological stress.[3] Some estimates indicate that the vast majority of individual animals in existence live in the wild.[4] A vast amount of natural suffering has been described as an unavoidable consequence of Darwinian evolution[5] and the pervasiveness of reproductive strategies which favor producing large numbers of offspring, with a low amount of parental care and of which only a small number survive to adulthood, the rest dying in painful ways, has led some to argue that suffering dominates happiness in nature.[1][6][7]
The topic has historically been discussed in the context of the philosophy of religion as an instance of the problem of evil.[8] More recently, starting in the 19th-century, a number of writers have considered the suspected scope of the problem from a secular standpoint as a general moral issue, one that humans might be able to take actions toward preventing.[9] There is considerable disagreement around this latter point as many believe that human interventions in nature, for this reason, should not take place because of practicality,[10] valuing ecological preservation over the well-being and interests of individual animals,[11] considering any obligation to reduce wild animal suffering implied by animal rights to be absurd,[12] or viewing nature as an idyllic place where happiness is widespread.[6] Some have argued that such interventions would be an example of human hubris, or playing God and use examples of how human interventions, for other reasons, have unintentionally caused harm.[13] Others, including animal rights writers, have defended variants of a laissez-faire position, which argues that humans should not harm wild animals, but that humans should not intervene to reduce natural harms that they experience.[14][15]
