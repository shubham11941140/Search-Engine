There are more than 2000 species of fauna that can be found in Tamil Nadu.[1] This rich wildlife is attributed to the diverse relief features as well as favorable climate and vegetation in the Indian state.[2]Recognizing the state's role in preserving the current environment, the state government has established several wildlife and bird sanctuaries as well as national parks, which entail stringent protective measures. Tamil Nadu is also included in the International Network of Biosphere Reserves, which facilitates international recognition and additional funding.[3] There are five national parks and 17 sanctuaries that serve as homes to the wildlife.
Tamil Nadu is known for the diversity of its mammals due to the varying environs that sustain both dry and moist deciduous forests.[4] Notable species include Arboreal animals distributed in its hills, grasslands, mangroves, scrubs and forests. These also include vulnerable species like the Bengal tiger, Nilgiri Tahr, and the lion-tailed macaque.
